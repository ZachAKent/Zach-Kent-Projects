<p align=center><b><i>Hello there!</i></b></p>
&emsp;Welcome to my GitHub profile. Here, I have a couple of personal projects I have been working on beginning from my time as a student at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) up to the present.<br>
<br>
&emsp;Due to my current occupation being on internal or proprietary systems, I am not able to share what I do professionally on my Git account. Nor can I provide direct links to them.<br>
<br>
&emsp;Instead, the projects here are things I do in my off-time. I hope to continue working on projects both so that I share what I can do and my style of coding and possibly help others with what I know should anyone<br>
come across any of my projects looking for possible solutions for their own projects.<br>
<br>
Have a great day!<br>
-Zach
